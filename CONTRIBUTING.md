- Contributions should be added via a pull request. Once merged, the contributed code will be made available under the GNU GPL v3.0 specified in `LICENSE`
- New code should be added to the `OptimalTransport.jl` file [subject to change in future if this becomes unwieldly]
- New code should have function- (and/or file-) level documentation in the [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) format
- For new functionality, add a numerical example to the `examples` directory, and consider updating the `README`.
